# Sentiment-Driven-Colour-Palette
Hello, welcome to my project. 
The Sentiment-Driven Colour Palette Tool is an interactive visual tool built using Processing. This project uses sentiment analysis to determine the user's emotional state and generates a color palette based on their mood. By merging color psychology and emotional expression, this tool provides a unique way to explore self-expression through color.

# Key Features:
Sentiment-based Color Palette: Generates a color palette tailored to the user's mood.
Interactive Visuals: Features animated, color-coded circles that move in a circular path, pulsating in response to the selected mood.
Customizable Moods: Input different moods and see the corresponding color palettes, designed using color psychology principles.
Dynamic Visual Effects: The circles pulsate and shift, providing an engaging, interactive experience.

# Motivation
The goal of this project is to connect emotions with colour, encouraging users to explore how their mood influences their fashion choices. By using sentiment analysis, the tool helps users visualise and choose colors that reflect their current emotional state.
