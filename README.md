# Sentiment-Driven-Colour-Palette
Hello, welcome to my project. 
The Sentiment-Driven Colour Palette Tool is an interactive visual tool built using Processing. This project uses sentiment analysis to determine the user's emotional state and generates a colour palette based on their mood. By merging colour psychology and emotional expression, this tool provides a unique way to explore self-expression through colour.

# Key Features:
Sentiment-based Color Palette: Generates a colour palette tailored to the user's mood.
Interactive Visuals: Features animated, colour-coded circles that move in a circular path, pulsating in response to the selected mood.
Customisable Moods: Input different moods and see the corresponding colour palettes, designed using colour psychology principles.
Dynamic Visual Effects: The circles pulsate and shift, providing an engaging, interactive experience.

# Motivation
The goal of this project is to connect emotions with colour, encouraging users to explore how their mood influences their daily palette. By using sentiment analysis, the tool helps users visualise and choose colours that reflect their current emotional state.
