# Sentiment-Driven-Colour-Palette
Hello, welcome to my project. To use my code, open Processing in Java mode. Then find this line of code "text("Mood: " + userInput, 20, 50); // Display the user mood input" and replace "mood:" with one the ten following moods that most aligns with how you are feeling:
Happy 
Sad 
Angry 
Excited 
Calm 
Love 
Confused 
Nervous 
Surprised 
Bored 

The code will produce a colour palette for you based on your selected mood. Enjoy!
